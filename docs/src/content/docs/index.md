# About

:::caution
This documentation is written for Loot Table Modifier v2 alpha 1.  
Both the mod and this wiki are in development.  
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please *please* **please** come join my [discord](https://discord.offsetmonkey538.top) and yell at me about them.
:::


Vanilla datapacks can only replace existing loot tables, which is not good for being compatible with other datapacks that may also try to replace the same loot tables.  
This mod fixes that by implementing a system of *loot modifiers*, which do just that, modify loot (tables)!

Loot modifiers are in datapacks, meaning mods and modpacks are able to use them too!

:::note
There is also an online generator for loot modifiers in development and available [here](https://misode-2l52sq8cl-misodes-projects.vercel.app/) under 'Modded Generators'.  
It should be up to date with v2 alpha 1, but there may be issues. Please contat me on my [discord](https://discord.offsetmonkey538.top) if anything goes wrong :D
