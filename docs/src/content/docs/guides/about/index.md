# About

Vanilla datapacks can only replace existing loot tables, which is not good for being compatible with other datapacks that may also try to replace the same loot tables.  
This mod fixes that by implementing a system of *loot modifiers*, which do just that, modify loot (tables)!

Loot modifiers are in datapacks, meaning mods and modpacks are able to use them too!

:::note
There is also an online generator for loot modifiers in development and available [here](https://misode-2l52sq8cl-misodes-projects.vercel.app/) under 'Modded Generators'.  
It should be up to date with v2 alpha 1, but if there are any issues, please contat me on my [discord](https://discord.offsetmonkey538.top)
