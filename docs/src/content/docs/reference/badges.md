Badges are meant for developers to put on their project pages, so users can see that Loot Table Modifier is used or required.  
They're based on [Devin's Badges](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges).

The `requires` badge is meant for datapacks or mods which want to display that Loot Table Modifier is required for it to function.  
It can be used in Markdown like this: `[![This project requires Loot Table Modifier to be installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffsetMods538/Loot-Table-Modifier/master/images/requires_badge.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/loot-table-modifier)`  
And will look like this:  
[![This project requires Loot Table Modifier to be installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffsetMods538/Loot-Table-Modifier/master/images/requires_badge.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/loot-table-modifier)  
Clicking it will bring the user to the Modrinth page for Loot Table Modifier

The `uses` badge is meant for mods or modpacks which want to display that Loot Table Modifier is included. (Honestly not sure why I made this 'cause I can't imagine anyone would do that but uhh sure ðŸ˜…)  
It can be used in Markdown like this: `[![This project includes Loot Table Modifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffsetMods538/Loot-Table-Modifier/master/images/uses_badge.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/loot-table-modifier)`  
And will look like this:  
[![This project includes Loot Table Modifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OffsetMods538/Loot-Table-Modifier/master/images/uses_badge.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/loot-table-modifier)  
Clicking it will bring the user to the Modrinth page for Loot Table Modifier
